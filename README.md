# 100 Years of Music

This project is aimed to provide evidence that musical elements in popular music have changed throughout the decades in the 20th century and the first decade of the new millenium.

### Process

My hypothesis was that musical elements in popular music have changed throughout the decades. Mainly that some elements have become more of a staple than other in popular music. For example, rhythm and beats have become more prominent while harmony and melody has been less prominent.

To check if this hypothesis is correct, I researched [the top three songs](http://tsort.info/music/ds1900.htm) of a each decade from the 1900s to the 2000s. The list of songs used in this project is [here](https://github.com/katherinesdd53/Music/blob/master/Top%203%20List.csv). The CSV file is ordered in ascending order, the 1900s on the top and 2000s on the bottom.

Then, I colleted all of the MP3 files for each song to retreive its data. I decided to work with MP3 files because they are more common and easy to collect. Once the MP3 files were collected, I used a Python package called [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) to analyze the MP3 files.

With the data collected from the MP3 files, I worked on creating visual representations of the data to see whether or not there were changes in musical elements. If you want to see the graphs and my analysis, you can visit this [webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/musicintime/home).
